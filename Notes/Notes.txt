---------- TRAVERSING ----------



                                                | <Div>  |
                                                    |
                                                    |
                                                 | <ul> |  
                                           -------------------
                                           |                  |
                                           |                  | 
                                        | <li> |            | <li> |
                                            |                 |
                                            |                 |
                                     ---------------        | <b> |
                                     |              |
                                     |              |
                                 | <span> |     | <span> | 


Illustration explained:


          ->  The <div> element is the parent of <ul>, and an ancestor of everything inside of it.
          ->  The <ul> element is the parent of both <li> elements, and a child of <div>.
          ->  The left <li> element is the parent of <span>, child of <ul> and a descendant of <div>.
          ->  The <span> element is a child of the left <li> and a descendant of <ul> and <div>.
          ->  The two <li> elements are siblings (they share the same parent).
          ->  The right <li> element is the parent of <b>, child of <ul> and a descendant of <div>.
          ->  The <b> element is a child of the right <li> and a descendant of <ul> and <div>.





Traversing the DOM

        -> jQuery provides a variety of methods that allow us to traverse the DOM ( Document Object Model ).
        -> The largest category of traversal methods are tree-traversal.
        -> Three useful jQuery methods for traversing up( ancestor ) the DOM tree are:

                1. parent() - returns the direct parent element of the selected element.
                2. parents() - returns all ancestor elements of the selected element, all the way up to the document's root element (<html>).
                3. parentsUntil() - returns all ancestor elements between two given arguments.


        -> Two useful jQuery methods for traversing down ( descendant ) the DOM tree are:

                1. children() -  returns all direct children of the selected element.
                2. find() - returns descendant elements of the selected element, all the way down to the last descendant.


        -> There are many useful jQuery methods for traversing sideways ( siblings ) in the DOM tree:

                1. siblings() - returns all sibling elements of the selected element.
                2. next() - returns the next sibling element of the selected element.
                3. nextAll() - returns all next sibling elements of the selected element.
                4. nextUntil()- returns all next sibling elements between two given arguments.
                5. prev() - returns the previous sibling element of the selected element.
                6. prevAll() - returns all previous sibling elements of the selected element.
                7. prevUntil() - returns all previous sibling elements between two given arguments.

    
        -> The first(), last(), eq(), filter() and not() Methods

                1. first() -  returns the first element of the specified elements.
                2. last() - returns the last element of the specified elements.
                3. eq() - returns the element at the specified index within the set of matched elements.
                4. filter() - reduces the set of matched elements to those that match the specified filter.
                5. not() - removes elements from the set of matched elements that match the specified filter.
                



---------- jQuery DOM Manipulation ----------

Get Content - Three simple, but useful, jQuery methods for DOM manipulation are:

                -> text() - Sets or returns the text content of selected elements.
                -> html() - Sets or returns the content of selected elements (including HTML markup).
                -> val() - Sets or returns the value of form fields.
                -> attr() - method is used to get attribute values.


Set Content - We will use the same three methods from the previous page to set content:

                -> text() - Sets or returns the text content of selected elements.
                -> html() - Sets or returns the content of selected elements (including HTML markup).
                -> val() - Sets or returns the value of form fields.
                -> attr() - method is used to set/change attribute values.


Add New HTML Content - We will look at four jQuery methods that are used to add new content:

                -> append() - Inserts content at the end of the selected elements
                -> prepend() - Inserts content at the beginning of the selected elements
                -> after() - Inserts content after the selected elements
                -> before() - Inserts content before the selected elements


Remove Elements/Content - To remove elements and content, there are mainly two jQuery methods:

                -> remove() - Removes the selected element (and its child elements)
                -> empty() - Removes the child elements from the selected element



jQuery Manipulating CSS - jQuery has several methods for CSS manipulation:

                -> addClass() - Adds one or more classes to the selected elements
                -> removeClass() - Removes one or more classes from the selected elements
                -> toggleClass() - Toggles between adding/removing classes from the selected elements
                -> css() - Sets or returns the style attribute



jQuery Dimension Methods - jQuery has several important methods for working with dimensions:

                -> width() - method sets or returns the width of an element (excludes padding, border and margin).
                -> height() - method sets or returns the height of an element (excludes padding, border and margin).
                -> innerWidth() - method returns the width of an element (includes padding).
                -> innerHeight() - method returns the height of an element (includes padding).
                -> outerWidth() - method returns the width of an element (includes padding and border).
                -> outerHeight() - method returns the height of an element (includes padding and border).
                -> outerWidth(true) - method returns the width of an element (includes padding, border, and margin).
                -> outerHeight(true) - method returns the height of an element (includes padding, border, and margin).
